            <p>
              The thing I love about software engineering is that it allows me
              to be creative, solve puzzles, articulate vision, and build
              reality's.
            </p>

            <p>
              There is a thrill in seeing things 'become' and a reward for
              pushing through discomfort to gain understanding. I work with
              people to help their vision become a reality and I am constantly
              learning and pushing myself to grow. Please reach out if you have
              questions about my work, my process, or are interested in possibly
              working together.

                <p>
                  Great evil lies before and beyond The Veil, and Erekose
                  Wavewalker may be the only one living who can cross the
                  magical barrier to stop their apocalyptic reunion. Erekose
                  approaches his trusted friend, Ryu, to form a crew to take him
                  beyond The Veil and stop the calamity. Ryu has spent months
                  searching for the shadowy figures in the vision sent by his
                  goddess, Elhonna. At long last, Ryu, Seoul, Ki-smo, Shaedra,
                  and Jess gather in the Karnosean port city of Nyaru to begin
                  their journey across The Veil.
                </p>

                <p>
                  However, the party's movements have not gone unnoticed, and
                  members of the Unblinking Eye follow our heroes as they set
                  out to rendezvous with Erekose at the docks. By the skilled
                  blade of Shaedra, silver tongue of Jess, and a feeble attempt
                  at intimidation from Ki-smo the party is able to escape and
                  interrogate a poor young lackey (Trevor) of the Unblinking
                  Eye. Seoul "takes care of" the boy, and the group scouts out
                  the Eye's impressive flagship: the Whitecrest.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Deciding they have met their match, our heroes retreat to the
                  docks and find Erekose standing by with his boat, the Lookfar,
                  magically folded up in a convenient, ornate wooden box. Two
                  uneventful days pass as Erekose speeds their voyage by calling
                  upon Kord, the god of Storms, to fill their sails. Erekose
                  tells his crew about the evil creature Ralakor and his plan to
                  use the Heart of the Swarm to wrest control of Shinar's mind
                  flayers (illithid) from their Elder Brains. With such an army,
                  Ralakor would enslave all sentient beings of Shinar and launch
                  an invasion of the stars.
