Our heroes find themselves in a vast,\n                  cavernous room that once was a temple to a god known as The\n                  Traveler.

The ruined eyeball erupts in a flash of light that\n                  bounces around the room and causes ripples of color to cascade\n                  across a map of Pendor installed in the temple floor. About\n                  this time Ryu inspects the altar and finds a sigil of the dark\n                  god of undeath, the Whispered One. The back wall of the temple\n                  opens with an ominous rumbling of stone and an alien creature\n                  floats up from a hidden passageway beyond the wall.

The party barters with\n                  the old sea hag, and agrees to bring her the soul of one orc\n                  in return for information on the curse upon Damaia and her\n                  sword.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  The crew makes way back to the rowboat, but are startled by\n                  the rumble of thunder. Off in the distance they spot a ship\n                  pursuing the orc ship and recognize it as the Whitecrest,\n                  flagship of the Unblinking Eye. Our heroes concoct a daring\n                  plan to intercept the ships, and head back for the Mistress to\n                  join in on the action.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  On the approach, Ki-smo recruits the help of a friendly whale\n                  shark to give Shaedra a ride to the Whitecrest. After nearly\n                  loosing his footing while riding the shark, Shaedra manages to\n                  scale the flagship, kidnap a sailor, and whisk his prize off\n                  back to the sea. The rest of the party row to meet him under a\n                  hail of canon and gunfire, and extract their prize back to the\n                  Ragtag Mistress.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  After some interrogation, our heroes learn from the sailor\n                  that the Whitecrest is piloted by Captain Thelos who sails\n                  under the command of High Monitor Karrick, a high-ranking\n                  leader in the Unblinking Eye. This ship apparently found a way\n                  to cross the Veil and have been hot on the crew's pursuit\n                  since their crossing. Though not an orc, they figure this soul\n                  might do the trick to complete their bargain with Auntie\n                  Agatha, and they descend to her lair below the waves: a\n                  massive whale skeleton buried in the reef.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  We rejoin our heroes late in the evening of 22 Highsun 1493 in\n                  the lair of Auntie Agatha, who has been awaiting their arrival\n                  with great interest…\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"campaign hidden\">\n              <div class=\"campaign-title\">\n                <h2></h2>\n                <h3></h3>\n                <div class=\"more-info\"></div>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"recap-content\">\n                <p></p>\n                <p></p>\n                <p></p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"campaign\">\n              <div class=\"campaign-title\">\n                <h2>\n                  Map of Pendor\n                </h2>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img class=\"pendor\" src=\"/6ababea4731989b2e1019ba2c350fa86.jpg\" alt=\"Map of the Islands of Pendor\">\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"campaign\">\n              <div class=\"campaign-title\">\n                <h2>22 Highsun 1493</h2>\n                <h3>Auntie Agatha's Lair</h3>\n                <div class=\"more-info\"></div>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"recap-content\">\n                <p>\n                  Our heroes descend below the waves to visit a sea hag, Auntie\n                  Agatha, who makes her lair amidst the skeleton of a long-dead\n                  ancient beast of the deep. Upon their arrival they present\n                  their prize: a captive sailor's soul in exchange for\n                  information about the magical blade bound to their friend\n                  Damaia. Agatha scoffs at their very-much-alive offering and\n                  goads them into murdering the poor sailor. She mocks their\n                  needless cruelty before turning her gaze to Damaia's sword.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Agatha pours over the curved, black weapon and reads the\n                  ancient runes inscribed along its blade. She reveals that this\n                  is Nerazim's Blade, an ancient weapon of the Voidwalkers\n                  capable of severing the very tether that binds a soul to the\n                  Astral Plane. Damaia has no memory of how she came into\n                  possession of such a powerful artifact, but Agatha presents\n                  both a mystery and an answer. Agatha herself bound the sword\n                  to Damaia at the tiefling woman's request. She also holds a\n                  magical pipe that can re-enact the holder's most heroic memory\n                  in smoke. Damaia is eager to learn more of her past, and\n                  agrees to call upon the pipe's magic.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  As Damaia exhales the pipe's smoke, a dramatic battlefield\n                  unfolds before our heroes: dragonriders battle airborne foes\n                  while a massive, tentacled monster rips apart a large warship\n                  struggling for its life at sea. The vision zooms in on Damaia,\n                  riding on the back of a young dragon alongside a familiar face\n                  to Seoul: <span class=\"underline\">his long-lost uncle</span>.\n                  As defeat draws nigh Damaia clenches her jaw, hands a necklace\n                  to Seoul's uncle with a wink, and backflips off the dragon\n                  toward the tentacled behemoth below. Damaia gracefully plunges\n                  through the air, Nerazim's Blade outstretched, and as she\n                  meets the great beast the vision dissipates in a blinding\n                  flash of light.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Our heroes decide to maximize their visit to the sea hag, and\n                  ask her to release the blade's bond in exchange for agreeing\n                  that the blade's ownership shall pass to her in the event that\n                  <span class=\"underline\">the entire party dies</span>. They\n                  also negotiate for Agatha to arrange a visit with the Oracle\n                  in exchange for delivering a pendant as a wedding present to\n                  Agatha's niece, Lady Sylvana Crowley in Port Last on the isle\n                  of Eskel.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  The crew of the Ragtag Mistress part from Agatha's lair ready\n                  to set sail, but find themselves betrayed! Unbeknownst to our\n                  heroes, the sea hag magically summoned High Monitor Karrick,\n                  leader of the Unblinking Eye's contingent that has crossed the\n                  Veil pursuing them. The party manages to hide atop a cliff\n                  face, overhear Karrick's exchange with Agatha, and learn that\n                  Erekose has been taken captive. Chaos erupts as our heroes get\n                  the drop on the powerful trio of the Unblinking Eye. Karrick\n                  and crew retreat behind rocks and magical defenses and Ryu is\n                  dropped unconscious by his wounds from the Unblinking Eye\n                  archer. Our heroes rush to their rowboat to escape while\n                  Karrick summons a magical teleportation circle. As the crew\n                  rows away, Karrick pauses long enough to call down a mighty\n                  blast of unholy light and severely wounds most of the party.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  We rejoin our heroes in the morning of 23 Highsun 1493 aboard\n                  the Ragtag Mistress, with Nerazim's Blade resting lightly in\n                  Jess's hand, and Erekose's capture and Agatha's betrayal\n                  weighing heavy on their hearts…\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n
