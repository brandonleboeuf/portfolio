                  Great evil lies before and beyond The Veil, and Erekose
                  Wavewalker may be the only one living who can cross the
                  magical barrier to stop their apocalyptic reunion. Erekose
                  approaches his trusted friend, Ryu, to form a crew to take him
                  beyond The Veil and stop the calamity. Ryu has spent months
                  searching for the shadowy figures in the vision sent by his
                  goddess, Elhonna. At long last, Ryu, Seoul, Ki-smo, Shaedra,
                  and Jess gather in the Karnosean port city of Nyaru to begin
                  their journey across The Veil.
                </p>

                <p>
                  However, the party's movements have not gone unnoticed, and
                  members of the Unblinking Eye follow our heroes as they set
                  out to rendezvous with Erekose at the docks. By the skilled
                  blade of Shaedra, silver tongue of Jess, and a feeble attempt
                  at intimidation from Ki-smo the party is able to escape and
                  interrogate a poor young lackey (Trevor) of the Unblinking
                  Eye. Seoul "takes care of" the boy, and the group scouts out
                  the Eye's impressive flagship: the Whitecrest.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Deciding they have met their match, our heroes retreat to the
                  docks and find Erekose standing by with his boat, the Lookfar,
                  magically folded up in a convenient, ornate wooden box. Two
                  uneventful days pass as Erekose speeds their voyage by calling
                  upon Kord, the god of Storms, to fill their sails. Erekose
                  tells his crew about the evil creature Ralakor and his plan to
                  use the Heart of the Swarm to wrest control of Shinar's mind
                  flayers (illithid) from their Elder Brains. With such an army,
                  Ralakor would enslave all sentient beings of Shinar and launch
                  an invasion of the stars.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We rejoin our heroes on the morning of 10 Highsun 1493 as the
                  sun rises over the vast sea, illuminating the impenetrable,
                  massive wall of mist and light: The Veil…

                  We rejoin our heroes on the morning of 12 Highsun 1493 in a
                  small port town in The Southern Reach. The party has used the
                  coin from Erekose to procure and provision a ship for their
                  travels ahead, and they walk now to the docks to embark on

                  Our heroes sets sail aboard The Ragtag Mistress with "Captain
                  Dr." Seoul pointing the way and their new first mate, Ol' Mac,
                  at the helm. After five days at sea the crew arrive in the
                  port town of Haven on the isle of Hosk. They immediately
                  proceed to the dock district to grab beers at the Busty Maid
                  and Ryu draws the ire of a grumpy goliath with an aversion to
                  dragonborn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thanks to the watchful eye of Ki-Smo and the magical charms of
                  Jess, our heroes dissolve the tensions long enough for the
                  goliath to lead them to Beggar's Alley. Shaedra engages an old
                  man in a lively discussion regarding the number of persons
                  present, and gains access to a secret stronghold of the
                  Waykeepers. Once inside, he learns that the ancient weapon
                  they seek, Nerazim's Blade, was last seen in the possession of
                  a red tiefling named Damaia (aka "Glory"). Damaia has turned
                  herself over to the House of a Thousand Delights, run by a
                  powerful djinn named Ezrekai.

                  The crew returns to the Busty Maid to establish their plan,
                  but have the peace interrupted by the angry goliath who by now
                  has realized that magical wool had been pulled over his eyes.
                  When the dust settles, our heroes are left with a dead
                  goliath, a terrified blue tiefling woman, and a coin marking
                  patronage at the House of a Thousand Delights.

                  In the port city of Haven on the isle of Hosk the crew of the
                  Ragtag Mistress follow in the footsteps of adventurers
                  long-gone by splitting the party. Jess and Ki-Smo stay behind
                  with their confused new charge, a blue tiefling woman named
                  Joy, while Seoul, Ryu, and Shaedra head off to the mysterious

                  At the entrance to the House of a Thousand Delights our heroes
                  are met by an air genasi named Tempest. He denies them entry,
                  as there are no records of their membership, but offers an
                  alternate deal for a transference of membership. The crew pays
                  off the debt of the goliath they killed, Grom, and agrees to
                  replace the lost client by securing a new one. Our heroes
                  select a contract to procure the eye of a Spectator for Master
                  Branheim Woolford, a master craftsman who requires this
                  special component.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The team reunites for a night's rest, only to have their
                  evening's slumber interrupted by an unwelcome guest. A
                  cloaked, hooded, black dragonborn with a gleaming red eye
                  infiltrates their room under the cover of magical darkness and
                  chaos ensues. When the dust settles Joy is found bleeding out
                  in her bed while the dragonborn flees through the streets of
                  Haven and disappears into the religious district. The combined
                  healing powers of Jess, Ki-Smo, and Ryu stabilizes Joy long
                  enough for our heroes to rush her to the care of healers at
                  the temple of Ehlonna.

                  With the dragonborn's trail gone cold and Joy's fate in the
                  hands of the healers, the crew provisions for their mission
                  and set out to track down the lair of the Spectator. We rejoin

                  In the wilderness beyond city of Haven, our heroes come to the
                  lair of a Spectator and find the entryway barred by a familiar
                  wall of pure red light. Unfortunately for our heroes, the
                  statue guardians inside are also members of AA: Aggressive and
                  Animated. A fast battle ensues during which Ki-smo and Ryu do
                  some rock lifting exercises and Jess shows off the power of
                  Sacred Flame. When the rock dust settles our heroes build a
                  stone arch from the rubble to block the wall of light and gain
                  entry to the Spectator’s lair.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shaedra anchors rope to help the team repel down to the cavern
                  below, and thanks to a well-placed bedroll the whole team
                  makes it down safely. Our heroes find themselves in a vast,
                  cavernous room that once was a temple to a god known as The
                  Traveler. Seoul navigates a labyrinth built in to the floor
                  tiles and gains a boon from The Traveler, only to have it
                  taken away again when he hurls a telescope-looking contraption
                  containing an eyeball at the altar.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shaedra and Seoul both work at extracting the eyeballs from
                  these contraptions and manage to stab one but extract the
                  other. The ruined eyeball erupts in a flash of light that
                  bounces around the room and causes ripples of color to cascade
                  across a map of Pendor installed in the temple floor. About
                  this time Ryu inspects the altar and finds a sigil of the dark
                  god of undeath, the Whispered One. The back wall of the temple
                  opens with an ominous rumbling of stone and an alien creature
                  floats up from a hidden passageway beyond the wall. It turns
                  the gaze of its many eyes upon the ragtag crew of interlopers
                  and exclaims, “Why have you interfered? Identify yourselves,
                  intruders!”

                  into the lair of a Spectator who calls itself "Watcher 349".
                  After a brief conversation with the many-eyed monstrosity, the
                  party decides they have what they need and return to Haven
                  with a Spectator eye.

                  On their arrival, the party successfully bargains with Master
                  Woolford to pose as a prospective patron in the House of a
                  Thousand Delights for 1 week. During this time he has agreed
                  to provide our heroes with inside information in exchange for
                  splitting any costs incurred to maintain the ruse. The party
                  rests and decides to venture into town to seek some
                  entertainment as the House is closed for their day of rest.

                  In Haven the adventurers come a cross a grand dueling
                  tournament that has drawn spectators and competitors from all
                  walks of life: peasants, merchants, nobles, clergy,
                  mercenaries, and sponsored athletes. Among the crowd they spot
                  a familiar air genasi, Tempest, accompanied by two large
                  brutes and a female red tiefling: Damaia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ki-smo concocts a plan to enter the duel as a contestant in
                  the hopes of getting face time with Damaia and convince her to
                  leave with them. However, the ragtag crew decides swifter
                  action is necessary. Shaedra poisons a mug of ale with pale
                  tincture to be delivered to Tempest, but the merchant chickens
                  out and warns Tempest as he hands him the mug. Meanwhile,
                  Shaedra and Seoul maneuver into position to sneak up upon
                  their foes. With a few swift kicks, a punch, some daggers, a
                  fog cloud spell, and a deafening thunderclap from Ryu the
                  dueling arena erupts into a massive brawl.

                  Brawl! The grand dueling tournament of Haven is thrown into
                  chaos by our ragtag crew of adventurers. At the epicenter of
                  the action Seoul summons a cloud of magical fog to provide
                  cover for Jess to extract the one person with information on

                  Jess works her magical charms on the red tiefling woman and
                  convinces her to leave with our heroes. Tempest and his guards
                  are disoriented by the fog cloud and a well-placed silent
                  image spell from Shaedra. Our heroes make their escape mostly
                  unnoticed while the House of a Thousand Delights crew start a
                  food fight and step in a bear trap in their confusion.

                  The crew races through the maze of tents and carts of the
                  dueling arena, evading Tempest's pursuit and dodging guard
                  patrols. However, at the very edge of the arena they find
                  their escape route blocked by a large crowd as the brawl
                  spills into the streets. Jess and Ki-Smo find a large warhorse
                  tied up outside a knight's tent, and use it to drive a wedge
                  through the brawling masses. Ki-Smo charges the horse into the
                  melee, sending bodies flying and trampling a few unfortunate
                  souls beneath the hooves of the powerful steed. The rest of
                  the crew escapes through the space left behind and retreat to
                  the safe confines of the Ragtag Mistress.

                  Ryu leads the visit to the Waykeepers and solicits the help of
                  Gate Keeper Elara in identifying Damaia's magical blade. After
                  some inspection, Elara confirms that it is, in fact, Nerazim's
                  Blade. However, Damaia seems to have been placed under a curse
                  that binds the sword to her. Elara suspects foul play on the
                  part of a sea hag known as Auntie Agatha Mudwallow, and
                  provides our heroes with a map to her lair.

                  The crew stocks up on potions and capsules to breathe
                  underwater at Gilmore's Glorious Goods, and set sail for the
                  lair of Auntie Agatha. After two days at sea The Ragtag
                  Mistress comes across flotsam strewn about from the remnants
                  of a sea elf rafts. As they search the wreckage a black sail
                  appears on the horizon.

                  We rejoin our heroes late in the afternoon of 22 Highsun 1493
                  as the other ship comes into view, boasting a hull covered in
                  sun-bleached bones...

                  As the sun sets over the
                  <span class="underline"> Eskellian Sea</span>, the crew of the
                  The Ragtag Mistress spots a ship boasting a hull covered in
                  sun-bleached bones. Shaedra recognizes the macabre décor, and
                  warns the party that the ship belongs to the pirating orc
                  nation he has encountered before. The party weighs anchor and
                  rows ashore the small island near Auntie Agatha's underwater
                  lair.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Approaching the island, our heroes find the shore covered in
                  the bodies of dead, rotting, mutated fish. Seoul picks one up
                  as a prize, and is surprised by the voice of Auntie Agatha
                  herself speak from its decaying mouth. The party barters with
                  the old sea hag, and agrees to bring her the soul of one orc
                  in return for information on the curse upon Damaia and her
                  sword.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The crew makes way back to the rowboat, but are startled by
                  the rumble of thunder. Off in the distance they spot a ship
                  pursuing the orc ship and recognize it as the Whitecrest,
                  flagship of the Unblinking Eye. Our heroes concoct a daring
                  plan to intercept the ships, and head back for the Mistress to
                  join in on the action.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the approach, Ki-smo recruits the help of a friendly whale
                  shark to give Shaedra a ride to the Whitecrest. After nearly
                  loosing his footing while riding the shark, Shaedra manages to
                  scale the flagship, kidnap a sailor, and whisk his prize off
                  back to the sea. The rest of the party row to meet him under a
                  hail of canon and gunfire, and extract their prize back to the
                  Ragtag Mistress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After some interrogation, our heroes learn from the sailor
                  that the Whitecrest is piloted by Captain Thelos who sails
                  under the command of High Monitor Karrick, a high-ranking
                  leader in the Unblinking Eye. This ship apparently found a way
                  to cross the Veil and have been hot on the crew's pursuit
                  since their crossing. Though not an orc, they figure this soul
                  might do the trick to complete their bargain with Auntie
                  Agatha, and they descend to her lair below the waves: a
                  massive whale skeleton buried in the reef.

                  Our heroes descend below the waves to visit a sea hag, Auntie
                  Agatha, who makes her lair amidst the skeleton of a long-dead
                  ancient beast of the deep. Upon their arrival they present
                  their prize: a captive sailor's soul in exchange for
                  information about the magical blade bound to their friend
                  Damaia. Agatha scoffs at their very-much-alive offering and
                  goads them into murdering the poor sailor. She mocks their
                  needless cruelty before turning her gaze to Damaia's sword.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Agatha pours over the curved, black weapon and reads the
                  ancient runes inscribed along its blade. She reveals that this
                  is Nerazim's Blade, an ancient weapon of the Voidwalkers
                  capable of severing the very tether that binds a soul to the
                  Astral Plane. Damaia has no memory of how she came into
                  possession of such a powerful artifact, but Agatha presents
                  both a mystery and an answer. Agatha herself bound the sword
                  to Damaia at the tiefling woman's request. She also holds a
                  magical pipe that can re-enact the holder's most heroic memory
                  in smoke. Damaia is eager to learn more of her past, and
                  agrees to call upon the pipe's magic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Damaia exhales the pipe's smoke, a dramatic battlefield
                  unfolds before our heroes: dragonriders battle airborne foes
                  while a massive, tentacled monster rips apart a large warship
                  struggling for its life at sea. The vision zooms in on Damaia,
                  riding on the back of a young dragon alongside a familiar face
                  to Seoul: <span class="underline">his long-lost uncle</span>.
                  As defeat draws nigh Damaia clenches her jaw, hands a necklace
                  to Seoul's uncle with a wink, and backflips off the dragon
                  toward the tentacled behemoth below. Damaia gracefully plunges
                  through the air, Nerazim's Blade outstretched, and as she
                  meets the great beast the vision dissipates in a blinding
                  flash of light.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our heroes decide to maximize their visit to the sea hag, and
                  ask her to release the blade's bond in exchange for agreeing
                  that the blade's ownership shall pass to her in the event that
                  <span class="underline">the entire party dies</span>. They
                  also negotiate for Agatha to arrange a visit with the Oracle
                  in exchange for delivering a pendant as a wedding present to
                  Agatha's niece, Lady Sylvana Crowley in Port Last on the isle
                  of Eskel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The crew of the Ragtag Mistress part from Agatha's lair ready
                  to set sail, but find themselves betrayed! Unbeknownst to our
                  heroes, the sea hag magically summoned High Monitor Karrick,
                  leader of the Unblinking Eye's contingent that has crossed the
                  Veil pursuing them. The party manages to hide atop a cliff
                  face, overhear Karrick's exchange with Agatha, and learn that
                  Erekose has been taken captive. Chaos erupts as our heroes get
                  the drop on the powerful trio of the Unblinking Eye. Karrick
                  and crew retreat behind rocks and magical defenses and Ryu is
                  dropped unconscious by his wounds from the Unblinking Eye
                  archer. Our heroes rush to their rowboat to escape while
                  Karrick summons a magical teleportation circle. As the crew
                  rows away, Karrick pauses long enough to call down a mighty
                  blast of unholy light and severely wounds most of the party.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We rejoin our heroes in the morning of 23 Highsun 1493 aboard
                  the Ragtag Mistress, with Nerazim's Blade resting lightly in
                  Jess's hand, and Erekose's capture and Agatha's betrayal
                  weighing heavy on their hearts…
